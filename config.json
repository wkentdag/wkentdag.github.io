  "about": "I'm a full-stack developer with over two years of experience crafting responsive websites, creating database schemas, and designing scalable APIs, both as a freelancer for independent clients and as part of a development team. I also have several years' experience mining large data sets to generate programmatic art and music. I believe that beautiful design is predicated by elegant code, and vice versa; I am looking for jobs (freelance or full-time) that allow me to work at that point of intersection.",
